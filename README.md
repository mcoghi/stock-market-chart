=========================

https://mhl-stockmarket.glitch.me/

An app that displays some stocks since the beggining of 2017.

Any user can display a new stock or delete an existing one. Once one of this operations is done, all the other users receive an update.

There is the possibility to switch between two visualizations of the data:
- total value of the stock
- percentage variation since the beggining of the year
